# Welcome!

I would first of all, like to comment on everyone whoc has taken their time and dedication to come to this github repository rather than some other one. The aim of our project is to prevent kangaroos from dying in human envirnments because of humans, so thanks to all who came to this repo.

The contributing guidelines are as simple as follows - 

1. Short, sharp to the point!
> It is great that you are trying to get your mssage across in a meaningful way, but unfortuantely, we ar in the time where people don't have enough... time If you want an urgent response, keep it short and sharp.
2. Nothing Inapproprate!
> No inappropriateness. The creators of this project and repo are still kids. Please do not put anything inappropriate or irrelevant to your topic.
3. Feel Free!
> All ideas are appreciated! And so are questions! Ask questions in our issues section or email me at rudratheastronaut@gmail.com

Have a great day!
